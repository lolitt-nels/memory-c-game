**Memory Game README**

Welcome to our simple Memory game implemented in C! This program allows you to test and improve your memory skills by matching pairs of cards.

### How to Play:
1. **Compile the Code:**
    - Compile the source code (`memory.c`) using your preferred C compiler. For example:
        ```
        gcc -o memory memory.c
        ```
2. **Run the Game:**
    - Execute the compiled binary:
        ```
        ./memory
        ```
3. **Gameplay:**
    - The game starts with a grid of face-down cards, each containing a number.
    - Flip two cards over each turn by entering their corresponding numbers when prompted.
    - If the numbers on the flipped cards match, they remain face-up.
    - If the numbers do not match, the cards are flipped face-down again.
    - The game continues until all pairs have been matched.
4. **Winning:**
    - The game ends when all pairs of cards have been matched.
    - You win by matching all pairs in the minimum number of attempts possible.
5. **Exiting:**
    - To exit the game at any time, press `Ctrl + C` or follow the on-screen instructions.
